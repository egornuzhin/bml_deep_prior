Course project for Bayesian Methods 2018, Skoltech

Papers:
  1. Deep Prior: http://bayesiandeeplearning.org/2017/papers/61.pdf 
  2. Towards a Neural Statistician: https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HJDBUF5le
  
      Recent published articles shows the way how to use information from similar databases to improve prediction or generation quality on particular one.
  Our Goal is to repeat results appeared in Deep Prior and Towards a Neural Statistician. Discuss benefits and disadvantages both of them.
  And compare described techniques on identical tasks such as regression and classification.
